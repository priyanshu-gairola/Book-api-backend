# ðŸ“š FastAPI Bookstore API

This project is a **backend REST API** built using **FastAPI**, designed to manage a bookstore system.

It includes:

- **User authentication** using JWT tokens
- **Role-based access control** (admin vs user)
- **CRUD operations** for managing books
- **SQLite** as the database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Secure password hashing** using bcrypt

The goal is to build a production-style backend API with clean code, modular structure, and essential backend development practices.
